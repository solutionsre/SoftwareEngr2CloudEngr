### 📘 Month 6: Portfolio Projects + Certification
- 🧪 Build 3 Cloud-Native Projects:
  1. Serverless App: Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB
  2. Dockerized App: Kubernetes + Terraform + CI/CD
  3. Infra Monitoring Dashboard: Prometheus + Grafana

- 📜 Get Certified:
  - AWS Cloud Practitioner (for all)
  - AWS DevOps Engineer Associate (advanced)
